Finding the most reliable way on graph using "inversed" Dijsktra's algorithm.

The algorithm solves the graph problem.
There are vertexes and edges in the graph. The edges are rated by the number between 0-1, 
which is the probability, that describes the probability of delivering signal between two vertexes.

First line of input *n* is the number of vertexes.
Second line of input *m* is the number of edges between all of the vertexes.
On the following *m* lines are two vertexes and the probability of the edge between those two vertexes.

On the Next N lines are the queries for the best way inbetween further specified vertexes.

The output is on N lines and it is the most reliable way from vertex A to B, thus the sequence of vertexes including A and B.
